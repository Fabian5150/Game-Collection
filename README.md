# Game-Collection

I'm trying to improve my Node and React skills, so I'm creating a classic game collection. 
When it's done, users are supposed to be able to join the server, create a room for them and their friends and play some classics.
I'm starting with easier games like tic tac toe and plan to work my way up to more complicated ones like chess.
